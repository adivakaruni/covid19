The world is stuggling to contain the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. With no cure available yet and the rapid surge of infections worldwide, governments have had no choice but to impose unprecedented restrictions on social contact and economic activity. Although COVID-19 originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, data from various sources shows that the disease spread quickly to over 184 countries and regions in just under four months (ref:JHU). Among these, the United States (US) has been the most affected with over 400,000 cases and 13,000 deaths at the time of writing. While this is certainly alarming, the rapidness with which the pandemic spread throughout the US is even more striking. There were just 7 confirmed cases across 6 US counties by end January, and mose of these had travelled to China recently. February also saw just 70 new cases across 22 counties, indicating that the US might have evaded the pandemic. These hopes were quickly dashed in the coming weeks as over 188,000 new cases were reported across 2,154 counties by March 31, 2020.

How did COVID-19 spread so quickly? What factors might have contributed to its rapid spread across so many regions? 


The ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has infected nearly 1.45 million people and claimed over 83,000 lives so far. With no effective treatment available as of yet, extensive research is underway to determine how the disease spreads, steps that can mitigate its progress, and the economic costs of mitigation. As part of these efforts, researchers and public health experts are relying mostly on SIR models to assess the effectiveness of various mitigation measures and guide policy decisions (ref: Atkeson, 2020). However, there is still no consensus on key epidemiological parameters such as the "basic reproduction number" (denoted R<sub>0</sub>) (the expected number of people infected by an ill person) that form the basis of these models.



In our times of unprecedented global connectedness and mobility, such epidemics are a major threat on a global scale due to small world network effects. One could conjecture that conditional on a global catastrophic event (loosely defined as > 100mln casualties) happening in 2020, the most likely cause would be precisely some pandemic â€” not a nuclear disaster, not climate catastrophe, etc. This is further aggravated by worldwide rapid urbanisation, with our densely populated dynamic cities turning into propagation nodes in the disease diffusion network, thus becoming extremely vulnerable and fragile.


The ensuing panic has forced governments to take unprecented steps to prevent the disease from spreading, such as mandatory social distancing, travel curbs, and closure of non-essential businesses. These measures have pretty much shut down the entire world economy, led to widespread unemployment, and sent shock waves across financial markets.

How does a pandemic spread across geographic regions? I apply spatial diffusion SIR models to show how air travel might contribute to the rapid spread of a pandemic over a large population. Simulations shown here demonstrate how flight connections between US cities could have led to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across US counties.

Preliminary estimates show that over 40% of the US population might have been infected when there are no restrictions on air travel.

More detailed description and analysis to follow shortly.
