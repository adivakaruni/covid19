How does a pandemic spread across geographic regions? I apply spatial diffusion SIR models to show how air travel might contribute to the rapid spread of a pandemic over a large population. Simulations shown here demonstrate how flight connections between US cities could have led to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across US counties.

Preliminary estimates show that over 40% of the US population might have been infected when there are no restrictions on air travel.

More detailed description and analysis to follow shortly.
