<p>To do</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The world is stuggling to contain the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. With no cure in sight and the rapid surge of infections worldwide, governments have had no choice but to impose unprecedented restrictions on social contact and economic activity. Although COVID-19 originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, data from various sources show that the disease has spread rapidly to over 184 countries and regions in just under four months (ref:JHU). Among these, the United States (US) has been the worst affected with over 400,000 cases and 13,000 deaths at the time of writing. While this is in itself alarming, the rapidness with which the pandemic spread throughout the US is even more striking. There were just 7 confirmed cases across 6 US counties by end January, with most having travelled to China recently. February also saw just 70 new cases across 22 counties, raising hopes that the US might have evaded the pandemic. These hopes were dashed in the coming weeks as over 188,000 new cases were reported across 2,154 counties in March 2020.

How did COVID-19 spread so quickly within the US? What factors have led to its rapid spread across the country? In this article, I explore whether air travel might have contributed to the pandemic becoming a major threat due to small world network effects. The massive growth in air travel in recent decades means that an infectious disease like COVID-19 can spread very quickly between regions. This can be further aggravated by urbanisation, with densely populated areas such as cities experiencing high rates of infection and also becoming major transmission nodes in the disease diffusion network. Such rapid transmission was detected during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, which began in Hong Kong and then spread rapidly as infected persons travelled to other countries (ref: Hollingsworth et al., 2003).

With no effective treatment available as of yet, extensive research is underway to determine how the disease spreads, steps that can mitigate its progress, and the economic costs of mitigation. As part of these efforts, researchers and public health experts are relying mostly on SIR models to assess the effectiveness of various mitigation measures and guide policy decisions (ref: Atkeson, 2020). However, there is still no consensus on key epidemiological parameters such as the "basic reproduction number" (denoted R<sub>0</sub>) (the expected number of people infected by an ill person) that form the basis of these models.

<b>Air travel in the United States</b>
<p>
The United States boasts an extensive air transportation network. According to 2019 data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), there were 1,272 airports with scheduled passenger services, of which 37 airports handled over 10 million passengers annually. In addition, the 50 busiest airports handled 82% of all traffic in the country. Due to increased competition, air travel is now more affordable and is the preferred means of transportation, especially for domestic destinations (ref: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/10/11/the-state-of-air-travel-in-the-u-s-has-changed-over-the-years/#36122d9e29b6). Figure 1 shows the connectivity between various airports.

Effective, efficient, and sustainable urban mobility is of crucial importance for the functioning of modern cities. It has been shown to directly affect livability and economic output (GDP) of cities. However, in the event of an epidemic, it will add fuel to the fire, amplifyig and propagating the disease spread.

The connectivity of human populations defines the spread of infectious diseases: cities that are visited frequently experience more introductions of vector borne1,2 and directly transmitted3,4 infections. Estimates of mobility have been used to inform targeting of control efforts5 and to characterize the spatial spread of emergent pathogens2,6–8, demonstrating the public health implications of human connectivity. Despite the connection between travel and infectious disease spread, one major feature of human mobility has been neglected in most applications to date: human mobility is generally seasonal9–12.

<p>
How does a pandemic spread across geographic regions? I apply spatial diffusion SIR models to show how air travel might contribute to the rapid spread of a pandemic over a large population. Simulations shown here demonstrate how flight connections between US cities could have led to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across US counties.

Preliminary estimates show that over 40% of the US population might have been infected when there are no restrictions on air travel.

More detailed description and analysis to follow shortly.

The ensuing panic has forced governments to take unprecented steps to prevent the disease from spreading, such as mandatory social distancing, travel curbs, and closure of non-essential businesses. These measures have pretty much shut down the entire world economy, led to widespread unemployment, and sent shock waves across financial markets.
