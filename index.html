<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has infected nearly 1.45 million people and claimed over 83,000 lives so far. Extensive research is underway to understand how this disease spreads, identify steps that can mitigate its progress, and the economic costs of mitigating COVID-19. A wide variety of economic models


The ensuing panic has forced governments to take unprecented steps to prevent the disease from spreading, such as mandatory social distancing, travel curbs, and closure of non-essential businesses. These measures have pretty much shut down the entire world economy, led to widespread unemployment, and sent shock waves across financial markets.


In the face of the rapidly growing COVID-19 pandemic, a wide variety of SIR models
of the progression of this epidemic are being used by public health experts to generate
scenarios that are being used to guide decisions to recommend and impose increas-
ingly severe mitigation measures on economies worldwide.1 Economists are not fully
familiar with the quantitative implications of these models and thus are not fully
engaged in the policy discussion regarding the tradeo between the public health
and economic implications of these mitigation and social distancing measures.

The recent 2019-nCoV Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China has sent shocks through financial markets and entire economies, and has duly triggered panic among the general population around the world. On 30 January 2020, 2019-nCoV was even designated a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of this writing, no specific treatment verified by medical research standards has yet been discovered. Moreover, some key epidemiological metrics such as the basic reproduction number (the average number of people infected by an ill individual) are still unknown. In our times of unprecedented global connectedness and mobility, such epidemics are a major threat on a global scale due to small world network effects. One could conjecture that conditional on a global catastrophic event (loosely defined as > 100mln casualties) happening in 2020, the most likely cause would be precisely some pandemic â€” not a nuclear disaster, not climate catastrophe, etc. This is further aggravated by worldwide rapid urbanisation, with our densely populated dynamic cities turning into propagation nodes in the disease diffusion network, thus becoming extremely vulnerable and fragile.

How does a pandemic spread across geographic regions? I apply spatial diffusion SIR models to show how air travel might contribute to the rapid spread of a pandemic over a large population. Simulations shown here demonstrate how flight connections between US cities could have led to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across US counties.

Preliminary estimates show that over 40% of the US population might have been infected when there are no restrictions on air travel.

More detailed description and analysis to follow shortly.
